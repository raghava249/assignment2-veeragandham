### Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Museum Mumbai

Formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum, **chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya  must visit by all history lovers. The cornerstone of the museum was laid by the Prince of Wales when he visited the city in 1905. ** During World War I,**the museum served as a military hospital. Later in 1923, it was formally inaugurated by Lady Llyod, wife of Governor General Llyod. The museum, now renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya has galleries spread over three floors, which display more than 50,000 exhibits: Indus Valley Civilization artifacts, and other relics from the time of the Guptas, Mauryas, Chalukyas, and Rashtrakuta. But it's not only the exhibits that capture the attention of tourists the most but the Indo-Saracenic Museum building, which was designed by George Witter
